# make it suitable for caseless comparisions. The casefold() method is an aggressive lower() method which convert strings to casefolded strings for caseless matching. The casefold() method is removes all case distinctions present in a string. It is used for caseless matching, i.e. ignores cases when comparing.
inp_str = ip_str.casefold()

# loop to count the vowels

       count[char] += 1
